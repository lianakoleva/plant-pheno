Deep phenotyping dataset contains 97 time-series image sequences of growth data from four Arbidopsis thaliana accessions: SF-2, CVI, Landsberg(Ler-1), and Columbia (Col-0). 
Each image sequence contains 22 time-series top-view images of four the different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.
Each image is of a single pot, cropped from a DSLR image of 160 pots. Full resolution images were color corrected, unwarped and undistored prior to cropping and processing.
Successive images are recorded at 12:00pm of every day. 
Image data for an addditional 455 accessions  from the growth experiment, but not used in the machine learning are in Rest_Accessions folder. 
The label of each sample is written at the end of its folder name.
Accessions_Info.csv contains the information about each sample (Position, Ecotype ID and Ecotype Name). Note that an additional 455 different accesssions, with just 1 replicate were also grown in this experiment. The data provided here is for the 4 ccesssions used in the deep learning project. All other data is available on request.
Original full resolution DSLR images and chamber conditions, etc are available from the authors.
